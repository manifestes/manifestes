    There is a double spooking the world, the double of abstraction. The fortunes 
    of states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending 
    classes - the landlords and farmers, the workers and capitalists - revere 
    yet fear the relentless abstraction of the world on which their fortunes yet 
    depend. All the classes but one. The hacker class. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">02. 
    Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or 
    music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering 
    the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. In 
    art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge 
    where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and 
    where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there 
    are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While hackers create these new 
    worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to others, 
    and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who control the 
    means for making worlds we alone discover. We do not own what we produce - 
    it owns us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">03. 
    And yet we don't quite know who we are. While we recognise our distinctive 
    existence as a group, as programmers, as artists or writers or scientists 
    or musicians, we rarely see these ways of representing ourselves as mere fragments 
    of a class experience that is still struggling to express itself as itself, 
    as expressions of the process of producing abstraction in the world. Geeks 
    and freaks become what they are negatively, through their exclusion by others. 
    Hackers are a class, but an abstract class, a class as yet to hack itself 
    into manifest existence as itself. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Abstraction 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">04. 
    Abstraction may be discovered or produced, may be material or immaterial, 
    but abstraction is what every hack produces and affirms. To abstract is to 
    construct a plane upon which otherwise different and unrelated matters may 
    be brought into many possible relations. It is through the abstract that the 
    virtual is identified, produced and released. The virtual is not just the 
    potential latent in matters, it is the potential of potential. To hack is 
    to produce or apply the abstract to information and express the possibility 
    of new worlds. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">05. 
    All abstractions are abstractions of nature. To abstract is to express the 
    virtuality of nature, to make known some instance of its manifold possibilities, 
    to actualise a relation out of infinite relationality. Abstractions release 
    the potential of physical matter. And yet abstraction relies on something 
    that has an independent existence to physical matter -- information. Information 
    is no less real than physical matter, and is dependent on it for its existence. 
    Since information cannot exist in a pure, immaterial form, neither can the 
    hacker class. Of necessity it must deal with a ruling class that owns the 
    material means of extracting or distributing information, or with a producing 
    class that extracts and distributes. The class interest of hackers lies in 
    freeing information from its material constraints.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">06. 
    As the abstraction of private property was extended to information, it produced 
    the hacker class as a class. Hackers must sell their capacity for abstraction 
    to a class that owns the means of production, the vectoralist class - the 
    emergent ruling class of our time. The vectorialist class is waging an intensive 
    struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property. Patents and 
    copyrights all end up in the hands, not of their creators, but of the vectoralist 
    class that owns the means of realising the value of these abstractions. The 
    vectoralist class struggles to monopolise abstraction. Hackers find themselves 
    dispossessed both individually, and as a class. Hackers come piecemeal to 
    struggle against the particular forms in which abstraction is commodified 
    and made into the private property of the vectoralist class. Hackers come 
    to struggle collectively against the usurious charges the vectoralists extort 
    for access to the information that hackers collectively produce, but that 
    vectoralists collectively come to own. Hackers come as a class to recognise 
    their class interest is best expressed through the struggle to free the production 
    of abstraction not just from the particular fetters of this or that form of 
    property, but to abstract the form of property itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">07. 
    What makes our times different is that what now appears on the horizon is 
    the possibility of a society finally set free from necessity, both real and 
    imagined, by an explosion in abstract innovations. Abstraction with the potential 
    once and for all to break the shackles holding hacking fast to outdated and 
    regressive class interests. The time is past due when hackers must come together 
    with all of the producing classes of the world - to liberate productive and 
    inventive resources from the myth of scarcity. "The world already possesses 
    the dream of a time whose consciousness it must now possess in order to actually 
    live it." </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Production 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">08. 
    Production produces all things, and all producers of things. Production produces 
    not only the object of the production process, but also the producer as subject. 
    Hacking is the production of production. The hack produces a production of 
    a new kind, which has as its result a singular and unique product, and a singular 
    and unique producer. Every hacker is at one and the same time producer and 
    product of the hack, and emerges in its singularity as the memory of the hack 
    as process. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">09. 
    Production takes place on the basis of a prior hack which gives to production 
    its formal, social, repeatable and reproducible form. Every production is 
    a hack formalised and repeated on the basis of its representation. To produce 
    is to repeat; to hack, to differentiate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">10. 
    The hack produces both a useful and a useless surplus, although the usefulness 
    of any surplus is socially and historically determined. The useful surplus 
    goes into expanding the realm of freedom wrested from necessity. The useless 
    surplus is the surplus of freedom itself, the margin of free production unconstrained 
    by production for necessity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">11. 
    The production of a surplus creates the possibility of the expansion of freedom 
    from necessity. But in class society, the production of a surplus also creates 
    new necessities. Class domination takes the form of the capture of the productive 
    potential of society and its harnessing to the production, not of liberty, 
    but of class domination itself. The ruling class subordinates the hack to 
    the production of forms of production that may be harnessed to the enhancement 
    of class power, and the suppression or marginalisation of other forms of hacking. 
    What the producing classes - farmers, workers and hackers - have in common 
    is an interest in freeing production from its subordination to ruling classes 
    who turn production into the production of new necessities, who wrest slavery 
    from surplus. The elements of a free productivity exist already in an atomised 
    form, in the productive classes. What remains is the release of its virtuality.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">12. 
    The class struggle, in its endless setbacks, reversals and compromises returns 
    again and again to the unanswered question - property - and the contending 
    classes return again and again with new answers. The working class questioned 
    the necessity of private property, and the communist party arose, claiming 
    to answer the desires of the working class. The answer, expressed in the Communist 
    Manifesto was to "centralise all instruments of production in the hands 
    of the state." But making the state the monopolist of property has only 
    produced a new ruling class, and a new and more brutal class struggle. But 
    perhaps this was not the final answer, and the course of the class struggle 
    is not yet over. Perhaps there is another class that can pose the property 
    question in a new way - and offer new answers to breaking the monopoly of 
    the ruling classes on property. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">13. 
    There is a class dynamic driving each stage of the development of the vectoral 
    world in which we now find ourselves. The pastoralist class disperse the great 
    mass of peasants who traditionally worked the land under the thumb of feudal 
    landlords. The pastoralists supplant the feudal landlords, releasing the productivity 
    of the land which they claim as their private property. As new forms of abstraction 
    make it possible to produce a surplus from the land with fewer and fewer farmers, 
    pastoralists turn them off their land, depriving them of their living. Dispossessed 
    farmers seek work and a new home in cities. Here farmers become workers, as 
    capital puts them to work in its factories. Capital as property gives rise 
    to a class of capitalists who own the means of production, and a class of 
    workers, dispossessed of it - and by it. Dispossessed farmers become workers, 
    only to be dispossessed again. Having lost their land, they lose in turn their 
    culture. Capital produces in its factories not just the necessities of existence, 
    but a way of life it expects its workers to consume. Commodified life dispossess 
    the worker of the information traditionally passed on outside the realm of 
    private property as culture, as the gift of one generation to the next, and 
    replaces it with information in commodified form. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">14. 
    Information, like land or capital, becomes a form of property monopolised 
    by a class of vectoralists, so named because they control the vectors along 
    which information is abstracted, just as capitalists control the material 
    means with which goods are produced, and pastoralists the land with which 
    food is produced. Information circulated within working class culture as a 
    social property belonging to all. But when information in turn becomes a form 
    of private property, workers are dispossessed of it, and must buy their own 
    culture back from its owners, the vectoralist class. The whole of time, time 
    itself, becomes a commodified experience. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">15. 
    Vectoralists try to break capital's monopoly on the production process, and 
    subordinate the production of goods to the circulation of information. The 
    leading corporations divest themselves of their productive capacity, as this 
    is no longer a source of power. Their power lies in monopolising intellectual 
    property - patents and brands - and the means of reproducing their value - 
    the vectors of communication. The privatisation of information becomes the 
    dominant, rather than a subsidiary, aspect of commodified life. As private 
    property advances from land to capital to information, property itself becomes 
    more abstract. As capital frees land from its spatial fixity, information 
    as property frees capital from its fixity in a particular object. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">16. 
    The hacker class, producer of new abstractions, becomes more important to 
    each successive ruling class, as each depends more and more on information 
    as a resource. The hacker class arises out of the transformation of information 
    into property, in the form of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, 
    copyright and the moral right of authors. The hacker class is the class with 
    the capacity to create not only new kinds of object and subject in the world, 
    not only new kinds of property form in which they may be represented, but 
    new kinds of relation beyond the property form. The formation of the hacker 
    class as a class comes at just this moment when freedom from necessity and 
    from class domination appears on the horizon as a possibility. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Property</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">17. 
    Property constitutes an abstract plane upon which all things may be things 
    with one quality in common, the quality of property. Land is the primary form 
    of property. Pastoralists acquire land as private property through the forced 
    dispossession of peasants who once shared a portion of it in a form of public 
    ownership. Capital is the secondary form of property, the privatisation of 
    productive assets in the form of tools, machines and working materials. Capital, 
    unlike land, is not in fixed supply or disposition. It can be made and remade, 
    moved, aggregated and dispersed. An infinitely greater degree of potential 
    can be released from the world as a productive resource once the abstract 
    plane of property includes both land and capital - such is capital's 'advance'. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">18. 
    The capitalist class recognises the value of the hack in the abstract, whereas 
    the pastoralists were slow to appreciate the productivity that can flow from 
    the application of abstraction to the production process. Under the influence 
    of capital, the state sanctions forms of intellectual property, such as patents 
    and copyrights, that secure an independent existence for hackers as a class, 
    and a flow of innovations in culture as well as science from which development 
    issues. Information, once it becomes a form of property, develops beyond a 
    mere support for capital - it becomes the basis of a form of accumulation 
    in its own right. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">19. 
    Hackers must calculate their interests not as owners, but as producers, for 
    this is what distinguishes them from the vectoralist class. Hackers do not 
    merely own, and profit by owning information. They produce new information, 
    and as producers need access to it free from the absolute domination of the 
    commodity form. Hacking as a pure, free experimental activity must be free 
    from any constraint that is not self imposed. Only out of its liberty will 
    it produce the means of producing a surplus of liberty and liberty as a surplus. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">20. 
    Private property arose in opposition not only to feudal property, but also 
    to traditional forms of the gift economy, which were a fetter to the increased 
    productivity of the commodity economy. Qualitative, gift exchange was superseded 
    by quantified, monetised exchange. Money is the medium through which land, 
    capital, information and labour all confront each other as abstract entities, 
    reduced to an abstract plane of measurement. The gift becomes a marginal form 
    of property, everywhere invaded by the commodity, and turned towards mere 
    consumption. The gift is marginal, but nevertheless plays a vital role in 
    cementing reciprocal and communal relations among people who otherwise can 
    only confront each other as buyer and sellers of commodities. As vectoral 
    production develops, the means appear for the renewal of the gift economy. 
    Everywhere that the vector reaches, it brings into the orbit of the commodity. 
    But everywhere the vector reaches, it also brings with it the possibility 
    of the gift relation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">21. 
    The hacker class has a close affinity with the gift economy. The hacker struggles 
    to produce a subjectivity that is qualitative and singular, in part through 
    the act of the hack itself. The gift, as a qualitative exchange between singular 
    parties allows each party to be recognised as a singular producer, as a subject 
    of production, rather than as a commodified and quantified object. The gift 
    expresses in a social and collective way the subjectivity of the production 
    of production, whereas commodified property represents the producer as an 
    object, a quantifiable commodity like any other, of relative value only. The 
    gift of information need not give rise to conflict over information as property, 
    for information need not suffer the artifice of scarcity once freed from commodification. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">22. 
    The vectoralist class contributed, unwittingly, to the development of the 
    vectoral space within which the gift as property could return, but quickly 
    recognised its error. As the vectoral economy develops, less and less of it 
    takes the form of a social space of open and free gift exchange, and more 
    and more of it takes the form of commodified production for private sale. 
    The vectoralist class can grudgingly accommodate some margin of socialised 
    information, as the price it pays in a democracy for the furtherance of its 
    main interests. But the vectoralist class quite rightly sees in the gift a 
    challenge not just to its profits but to its very existence. The gift economy 
    is the virtual proof for the parasitic and superfluous nature of vectoralists 
    as a class.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Vector 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">23. 
    In epidemiology, a vector is the particular means by which a given pathogen 
    travels from one population to another. Water is a vector for cholera, bodily 
    fluids for HIV. By extension, a vector may be any means by which information 
    moves. Telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications: these terms name 
    not just particular vectors, but a general abstract capacity that they bring 
    into the world and expand. All are forms of telesthesia, or perception at 
    a distance. A given media vector has certain fixed properties of speed, bandwidth, 
    scope and scale, but may be deployed anywhere, at least in principle. The 
    uneven development of the vector is political and economic, not technical.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">24. 
    With the commodification of information comes its vectoralisation. Extracting 
    a surplus from information requires technologies capable of transporting information 
    through space, but also through time. The archive is a vector through time 
    just as communication is a vector that crosses space. The vectoral class comes 
    into its own once it is in possession of powerful technologies for vectoralising 
    information.&nbsp;The vectoral class may commodify information stocks, flows, 
    or vectors themselves. A stock of information is an archive, a body of information 
    maintained through time that has enduring value. A flow of information is 
    the capacity to extract information of temporary value out of events and to 
    distribute it widely and quickly. A vector is the means of achieving either 
    the temporal distribution of a stock, or the spatial distribution of a flow 
    of information. Vectoral power is generally sought through the ownership of 
    all three aspects.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">25. 
    The vectoral class ascend to the illusion of an instantaneous and global plane 
    of calculation and control. But it is not the vectoralist class that comes 
    to hold subjective power over the objective world. The vector itself usurps 
    the subjective role, becoming the sole repository of will toward a world that 
    can be apprehended only in its commodified form. The reign of the vector is 
    one in which any and every thing can be apprehended as a thing. The vector 
    is a power over all of the world, but a power that is not evenly distributed. 
    Nothing in the technology of the vector determines its possible use. All that 
    is determined by the technology is the form in which information is objectified. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">26. 
    The vectoral class struggles at every turn to maintain its subjective power 
    over the vector, but as it continues to profit by the proliferation of the 
    vector, some capacity over it always escapes control. In order to market and 
    profit by the information it peddles over the vector, it must in some degree 
    address the vast majority of the producing classes as subjects, rather than 
    as objects of commodification. The hacker class seeks the liberation of the 
    vector from the reign of the commodity, but not to set it indiscriminately 
    free. Rather, to subject it to collective and democratic development. The 
    hacker class can release the virtuality of the vector only in principle. It 
    is up to an alliance of all the productive classes to turn that potential 
    to actuality, to organise themselves subjectively, and use the available vectors 
    for a collective and subjective becoming. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Education</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">27. 
    Education is slavery, it enchains the mind and makes it a resource for class 
    power. When the ruling class preaches the necessity of an education it invariably 
    means an education in necessity. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor 
    is it the necessary means to acquire knowledge. Education is the organisation 
    of knowledge within the constraints of scarcity. Education 'disciplines' knowledge, 
    segregating it into homogenous 'fields', presided over by suitably 'qualified' 
    guardians charged with policing the representation of the field. One may acquire 
    an education, as if it were a thing, but one becomes knowledgeable, through 
    a process of transformation. Knowledge, as such, is only ever partially captured 
    by education, its practice always eludes and exceeds it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">28. 
    The pastoralist class has resisted education, other than as indoctrination 
    in obedience. When capital required 'hands' to do its dirty work, the bulk 
    of education was devoted to training useful hands to tend the machines, and 
    docile bodies who would accept as natural the social order in which they found 
    themselves. When capital required brains, both to run its increasingly complex 
    operations and to apply themselves to the work of consuming its products, 
    more time spent in the prison house of education was required for admission 
    to the ranks of the paid working class. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">29. 
    The so-called middle class achieve their privileged access to consumption 
    and security through education, in which they are obliged to invest a substantial 
    part of their income. But most remain workers, even though they work with 
    information rather than cotton or metal. They work in factories, but are trained 
    to think of them as offices. They take home wages, but are trained to think 
    of it as a salary. They wear a uniform, but are trained to think of it as 
    a suit. The only difference is that education has taught them to give different 
    names to the instruments of exploitation, and to despise those their own class 
    who name them differently. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">30. 
    Where the capitalist class sees education as a means to an end, the vectoralist 
    class sees it as an end in itself. It sees opportunities to make education 
    a profitable industry in its own right, based on the securing of intellectual 
    property as a form of private property. To the vectoralists, education, like 
    culture, is just 'content' for commodification. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">31. 
    The hacker class have an ambivalent relationship to education. The hacker 
    class desires knowledge, not education. The hacker comes into being though 
    the pure liberty of knowledge in and of itself. The hack expresses knowledge 
    in its virtuality, by producing new abstractions that do not necessarily fit 
    the disciplinary regime of managing and commodifying education. . Hacker knowledge 
    implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the 
    gift of the result to a network of peers. Hacker knowledge also implies an 
    ethics of knowledge subject to the claims of public interest and free from 
    subordination to commodity production. This puts the hacker into an antagonistic 
    relationship to the struggle of the capitalist class to make education an 
    induction into wage slavery. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">32. 
    Only one intellectual conflict has any real bearing on the class issue for 
    hackers: Whose property is knowledge? Is it the role of knowledge to authorise 
    subjects through education that are recognised only by their function in an 
    economy by manipulating its authorised representations as objects? Or is it 
    the function of knowledge to produce the ever different phenomena of the hack, 
    in which subjects become other than themselves, and discover the objective 
    world to contain potentials other than it appears? </font></p>

    is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false. 
    To the hacker there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is 
    actual, the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domain of what 
    is real without being actual, what is not but which may be. To hack is to 
    release the virtual into the actual, to express the difference of the real.

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">34. 
    Through the application of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility 
    of production, the possibility of making something of and with the world - 
    and of living off the surplus produced by the application of abstraction to 
    nature - to any nature. Through the production of new forms of abstraction, 
    the hacker class produces the possibility of the future - not just 'the' future, 
    but an infinite possible array of futures, the future itself as virtuality. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">35. 
    Under the sanction of law, the hack becomes a finite property, and the hacker 
    class emerges, as all classes emerge, out of a relation to a property form. 
    Like all forms of property, intellectual property enforces a relation of scarcity. 
    It assigns a right to a property to an owner at the expense of non-owners, 
    to a class of possessors at the expense of the dispossessed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">36. 
    By its very nature, the act of hacking overcomes the limits property imposes 
    on it. New hacks supersede old hacks, and devalues them as property. The hack 
    as new information is produced out of already existing information. This gives 
    the hacker class an interest in its free availability more than in an exclusive 
    right. The immaterial nature of information means that the possession by one 
    of information need not deprive another of it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">37. 
    To the extent that the hack embodies itself in the form of property, it gives 
    the hacker class interests quite different from other classes, be they exploiting 
    or exploited classes. The interest of the hacker class lies first and foremost 
    in a free circulation of information, this being the necessary condition for 
    the renewed statement of the hack. But the hacker class as class also has 
    an interest in the representation of the hack as property, as something from 
    which a source of income may be derived that gives the hacker some independence 
    from the ruling classes. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">38. 
    The very nature of the hack gives the hacker a crisis of identity. The hacker 
    searches for a representation of what it is to be a hacker in the identities 
    of other classes. Some see themselves as vectoralists, trading on the scarcity 
    of their property. Some see themselves as workers, but as privileged ones 
    in a hierarchy of wage earners. The hacker class has produces itself as itself, 
    but not for itself. It does not (yet) possess a consciousness of its consciousness. 
    It is not aware of its own virtuality. It has to distinguish between its competitive 
    interest in the hack, and its collective interest in discovering a relation 
    among hackers that expresses an open and ongoing future.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Information 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">39. 
    Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains. Information is the 
    potential of potential. When unfettered it releases the latent capacities 
    of all things and people, objects and subjects. Information is indeed the 
    very potential for there to be objects and subjects. It is the medium in which 
    objects and subjects actually come into existence, and is the medium in which 
    their virtuality resides. When information is not free, then the class that 
    owns or controls it turns its capacity toward its own interest and away from 
    its own inherent virtuality. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">40. 
    Information has nothing to do with communication, or with media. "We 
    do not lack communication. On the contrary, we have too much of it. We lack 
    creation. We lack resistance to the present." Information is precisely 
    this resistance, this friction. At the urgings of the vectoralist class, the 
    state recognises as property any communication, any media product with some 
    minimal degree of difference recognisable in commodity exchange. Where communication 
    merely requires the repetition of this commodified difference, information 
    is the production of the difference of difference. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">41. 
    The arrest of the free flow of information means the enslavement of the world 
    to the interests of those who profit from information's scarcity, the vectoral 
    class. The enslavement of information means the enslavement of its producers 
    to the interests of its owners. It is the hacker class that taps the virtuality 
    of information, but it is the vectoralist class that owns and controls the 
    means of production of information on an industrial scale. Privatising culture, 
    education and communication as commodified content, distorts and deforms its 
    free development, and prevents the very concept of its freedom from its own 
    free development. While information remains subordinated to ownership, it 
    is not possible for its producers to freely calculate their interests, or 
    to discover what the true freedom of information might potentially produce 
    in the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">42. 
    Free information must be free in all its aspects - as a stock, as a flow, 
    and as a vector. The stock of information is the raw material out of which 
    history is abstracted. The flow of information is the raw material out of 
    which the present is abstracted, a present that forms the horizon the abstract 
    line of an historical knowledge crosses, indicating a future in its sights. 
    Neither stocks nor flows of information exist without vectors along which 
    they may be actualised. The spatial and temporal axes of free information 
    must do more offer a representation of things, as a thing apart. They must 
    become the means of coordination of the statement of a movement, at once objective 
    and subjective, capable of connecting the objective representation of things 
    to the presentation of a subjective action. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">43. 
    It is not just information that must be free, but the knowledge of how to 
    use it. Information in itself is a mere thing. It requires an active, subjective 
    capacity to become productive. Information is free not for the purpose of 
    representing the world perfectly, but for expressing its difference from what 
    is, and for expressing the cooperative force that transforms what is into 
    what may be. The test of a free society is not the liberty to consume information, 
    nor to produce it, nor even to implement its potential in private world of 
    one's choosing. The test of a free society is the liberty for the collective 
    transformation of the world through abstractions freely chosen and freely 
    actualised. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Representation 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">44. 
    All representation is false. A likeness differs of necessity from what it 
    represents. If it did not, it would be what it represents, and thus not a 
    representation. The only truly false representation is the belief in the possibility 
    of true representation. Critique is not a solution, but the problem itself. 
    Critique is a police action in representation, of service only to the maintenance 
    of the value of property through the establishment of its value. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">45. 
    The politics of representation is always the politics of the state. The state 
    is nothing but the policing of representation's adequacy to the body of what 
    it represents. Even in its most radical form, the politics of representation 
    always presupposes an abstract or ideal state that would act as guarantor 
    of its chosen representations. It yearns for a state that would recognise 
    this oppressed ethnicity, or sexuality, but which is nevertheless still a 
    desire for a state, and a state that, in the process, is not challenged as 
    an statement of class interest, but is accepted as the judge of representation. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">46. 
    And always, what is excluded even from this enlightened, imaginary state, 
    would be those who refuse representation, namely, the hacker class as a class. 
    To hack is to refuse representation, to make matters express themselves otherwise. 
    To hack is always to produce a difference, if only a minute difference, in 
    the production of information. To hack is to trouble the object or the subject, 
    by transforming in some way the very process of production by which objects 
    and subjects come into being and recognise each other by their representations. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">47. 
    The politics of information, of knowledge, advances not through a critical 
    negation of false representations but a positive politics of the virtuality 
    of statement. The inexhaustible surplus of statement is that aspect of information 
    upon which the class interest of hackers depends. Hacking brings into existence 
    the inexhaustible multiplicity of all codes, be they natural or social, programmed 
    or poetic. But as it is the act of hacking that composes, at one and the same 
    time, the hacker and the hack, hacking recognises no artificial scarcity, 
    no official licence, no credentialing police force other than that composed 
    by the gift economy among hackers themselves. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">48. 
    A politics that embraces its existence as statement, as affirmative difference, 
    not as negation can escape the politics of the state. To ignore or plagiarise 
    representation, to refuse to give it what it claims as its due, is to begin 
    a politics of statelessness. A politics which refuses the state's authority 
    to authorise what is a valued statement and what isn't. A politics which is 
    always temporary, always becoming something other than itself. Even useless 
    hacks may come, perversely enough, to be valued for the purity of their uselessness. 
    There is nothing that can't be valued as a representation. The hack always 
    has to move on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">49. 
    Everywhere dissatisfaction with representations is spreading. Sometimes its 
    a matter of breaking a few shop windows, sometimes of breaking a few heads. 
    So-called 'violence' against the state, which rarely amounts to more than 
    throwing rocks at its police, is merely the desire for the state expressed 
    in its masochistic form. Where some call for a state that recognises their 
    representation, others call for a state that beats them to a pulp. Neither 
    is a politics that escapes the desire cultivated within the subject by the 
    educational apparatus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">50. 
    Sometimes direct democracy is posited as the alternative. But this merely 
    changes the moment of representation - it puts politics in the hands of claimants 
    to an activist representation, in place of an electoral one.. Sometimes what 
    is demanded of the politics of representation is that it recognise a new subject. 
    Minorities of race, gender, preference demand the right to representation. 
    But soon enough they discover the cost. They must now police the meaning of 
    this representation, and police the adherence of its members to it. Even at 
    its best, in its most abstract form, on its best behaviour, the colour blind, 
    gender neutral, multicultural state just hands the value of representation 
    over to the commodity form. While this is progress, particularly for those 
    formerly oppressed by the state's failure to recognise their identity as legitimate, 
    it stops short at the recognition of expressions of subjectivity that seeks 
    to become something other than a representation that the state can recognise 
    and the market can value. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">51. 
    But there is something else hovering on the horizon of the representable. 
    There is a politics of the unrepresentable, a politics of the presentation 
    of the non-negotiable demand. This is politics as the refusal of representation 
    itself, not the politics of refusing this or that representation. A politics 
    which, while abstract, is not utopian. In its infinite and limitless demand, 
    it may even be the best way of extracting concessions precisely through its 
    refusal to put a name - or a price - on what revolt desires. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990000" size="2"><b>Revolt 
    </b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">52. 
    The revolts of 1989 are the signal events of our time. What the revolts of 
    1989 achieved was the overthrow of regimes so impervious to the recognition 
    of the value of the hack that they had starved not only their hackers but 
    also their workers and farmers of any increase in the surplus. With their 
    cronyism and kleptocracy, their bureaucracy and ideology, their police and 
    spies, they starved even their pastoralists and capitalists of innovative 
    transformation and growth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">53. 
    The revolts of 1989 overthrew boredom and necessity. At least for a time. 
    They put back on the world historical agenda the limitless demand for free 
    statement. At least for a time. They revealed the latent destiny of world 
    history to express the pure virtuality of becoming. At least for a time, before 
    new states cobbled themselves together and claimed legitimacy as representations 
    of what revolt desired. The revolts of 1989 opened the portal to the virtual, 
    but the states that regrouped around this opening soon closed it. What the 
    revolts really achieved was the making of the world safe for vectoral power. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">54. 
    The so-called anti-globalisation protests of the 90s are a ripple caused by 
    the wake of these signal events, but a ripple that did not know the current 
    to which it truly belonged. This movement of revolt in the overdeveloped world 
    identifies the rising vectoral power as a class enemy, but all too often it 
    allowed itself to be captured by the partial and temporary interests of local 
    capitalist and pastoralist classes. It was a revolt is in its infancy that 
    has yet to discover the connection between its engine of limitless desire 
    and free statement, and the art of making tactical demands. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">55. 
    The class struggle within nations and the imperial struggle between nations 
    has taken shape as two forms of politics. One kind of politics is regressive. 
    It seeks to return to an imagined past. It seeks to use national borders as 
    a new wall, a neon screen behind which unlikely alliances might protect their 
    existing interests in the name of a glorious past. The other form is the progressive 
    politics of movement. The politics of movement seeks to accelerate toward 
    an unknown future. It seeks to use international flows of information, trade 
    or activism as the eclectic means for struggling for new sources of wealth 
    or liberty that overcomes the limitations imposed by national coalitions. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">56. 
    Neither of these politics corresponds to the old notion of a left or right, 
    which the revolutions of 1989 have definitively overcome. Regressive politics 
    brings together luddite impulses from the left with racist and reactionary 
    impulses from the right in an unholy alliance against new sources of power. 
    Progressive politics rarely takes the form of an alliance, but constitutes 
    two parallel processes locked in a dialogue of mutual suspicion, in which 
    the liberalising forces of the right and the social justice and human rights 
    forces of the left both seek non-national and transnational solutions to unblocking 
    the system of power which still accumulates at the national level. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">57. 
    There is a third politics, which stands outside the alliances and compromises 
    of the post-89 world. Where both progressive and regressive politics are representative 
    politics, which deal with aggregate party alliances and interests, this third 
    politics is a stateless politics, which seeks escape from politics as such. 
    A politics of the hack, inventing relations outside of representation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">58. 
    Expressive politics is a struggle against commodity property itself. Expressive 
    politics is not the struggle to collectivise property, for that is still a 
    form of property. Expressive politics is the struggle to free what can be 
    free from both versions of the commodity form - its totalising market form, 
    and its bureaucratic state form. What may be free from the commodity form 
    altogether is not land, not capital, but information. All other forms of property 
    are exclusive. The ownership by one excludes, by definition, the ownership 
    by another. But information as property may be shared without diminishing 
    anything but its scarcity. Information is that which can escape the commodity 
    form. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2">59. 
    Politics can become expressive only when it is a politics of freeing the virtuality 
    of information. In liberating information from its objectification as a commodity, 
    it liberates also the subjective force of statement. Subject and object meet 
    each other outside of their mere lack of each other, by their desire merely 
    for each other. Expressive politics does not seek to overthrow the existing 
    society, or to reform its larger structures, or to preserve its structure 
    so as to maintain an existing coalition of interests. It seeks to permeate 
    existing states with a new state of existence, spreading the seeds of an alternative 
    practice of everyday life. </font></p>
